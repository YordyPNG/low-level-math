# low-level-math
The program tests addition and subtraction. In level 1, it tests only addition of numbers less than 10 whose sum is less than 10. In level 2, it tests addition of arbitrary one digit numbers (which means that the sum could be more than 10). In level 3, it tests subtractions of one digit numbers with a non-negative difference.
